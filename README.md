# Projectile Motion Simulator
This is a Python program that simulates the trajectory of a projectile, with and without air resistance.
This simulation assumes a constant drag coefficient for simplicity. 
Users can adjust parameters such as initial speed, launch angle, mass and radius of the projectile to explore how they affect its trajectory.

## Features 
- Graphical visualisation of the projectile's trajectory
- Calculates maximum height and flight time
- Uses the drag force equation with density of air at sea-level and a constant drag coefficient of 0.5

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- matplotlib

## Setup using Command Prompt (Windows) / Terminal (macOS/Linux)

2. Move into project directory
```bash
cd Projectile_Motion_Simulator
```
3. Install the required library
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
4. Run program
```bash
python Projectile_Motion_Simulator.py
```
