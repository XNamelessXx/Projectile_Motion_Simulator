# Projectile Motion Simulator
This is a Python program that simulates the trajectory of a projectile, with and without air resistance.
This simulation assumes a constant drag coefficient for simplicity. 
Users can adjust parameters such as initial speed, launch angle, mass and radius of the projectile to explore how they affect its trajectory.

## Features 
- Graphical visualisation of the projectile's trajectory
- Calculates maximum height and flight time
- Uses the drag force equation with density of air at sea-level and a constant drag coefficient of 0.5
